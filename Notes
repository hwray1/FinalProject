simulate movement of individuals through time (discrete)
	Out-most for loop
	-track what happens to populations
	-steps in weeks
	-each step(1wk)- can stay in population or move to new pop
		use landscape method for movement

	if indivdual moves
		remove from old list
		add to new list
		** OUTSIDE OF THE FOR LOOP

	calculate and print frequency of phenotype of individuals
	trajectory graph
		phenotype freq
		population sizes
		create plots


class Individual (self, phenotype)
	phenotype attribute

class Population (self, popSize, phenotype)
	list of individuals	
		all individuals in a population have same phenotype INITIALLY
	method to add a joining individual
	method to remove a leaving individual

class landscape (self, numPopulations)
	list of all populations
	
	dispersal probabilities to determine if an individual moves or stays(matrix)(2D list?)
	
	set starting pop size
		total number of individuals stay constant
		populations may change size

	method to determine movement based on dispersal matrix
